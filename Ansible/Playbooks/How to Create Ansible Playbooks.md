### *Info*
##### Ansible playbooks automate the manual work of installing softrware and managing configurations. They target hosts defined in Ansible inventories, and automate the installation and configuration of software, services, and policies on those hosts. For example, in an on-premise Windows domain environment, Ansible can be used to configure a new Domain Controller with the Active Directory Domain Services Role installed and promoted, DNS Zones configured, Chrome web browser installed, and windows update scheduled to run once a day at midnight. <sup>[1]</sup>
